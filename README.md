A function that when given 2 position A and B, returns the shortest path a knight would have to take to get to B from A.
To check the function you can clone the project or open from github's page-enviroment and use the function as such:
-if A = (xA,xB) and B = (xB,yB) and N - the length of the chessBoard, (NxN)
-findPath(xA,xB,xB,yB,N).show() will console.log the path :)
